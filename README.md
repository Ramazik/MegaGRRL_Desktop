## Firmware changes
The portable and desktop MegaGRRL versions share a single codebase, contained in the [normal MegaGRRL repo](https://git.agiri.ninja/natalie/megagrrl). Before compiling, `main/hal.h` must be edited to specify that the desktop version is built. More details on this are available in the assembly guide.
